IDEA:  Online Doctor Appointment Application for Govt. Hospitals
It is normally divided in three parts :
Patient’s portal
Doctor’s portal
Hospital’s portal
Patient’s Portal :
It has three Options namely SignIn , SignUp, and Continue without Signing – If a user signup then the app will create a account of user and his appointment details are saved for future reference.
If he sign-In than his saved details automatically get filled 
If he continue with signing In than he got a screen which will ask about his preferences and schedule a appointment with his doctor , he will be allotted a time and he can report their on his time, he has to also pay Rs. 10 for taking the service .
Doctor’s Portal :
He can sign In with his credentials and can view his list of patients for a particular day .

Hospital’s Portal :
He can sign In with his credentials and can add/Remove  doctors , Mark their attendance , so that if doctor is absent he can’t be scheduled for that day. It has also a option to register new hospitals. 
It has a option of End day ,which will copy the whole database to another directory  for further uses.

SO, we have created a MYSQL server of IP(172.26.59.26) as a host and anyone having the jar application can avail the service on a few clicks. The data from his end will be sent to server and will give response back.

Currently It has one hospital named ‘sms’ and password ‘SMS’ and one doctor named ‘himanshu’ and password ‘khandal’ and a single user name ‘lokesh’ and password ‘kedia’.
You can further add the new users , doctors ,hospitals , by visiting the respective portals.
The frames named :
NewJFrame		:	Patient’s Portal(Doctor’s Appointment)
NewJFrame1		:	Doctor’s portal
NewJFrame2		:	Hospital’s  portal
NewJFrame3		:	Patient’s Sign-In
NewJFrame4		:	Add/Remove Doctor
NewJFrame5		:	Main Screen (FRONT)
NewJFrame6		:	Patient’s Portal
NewJFrame7		:	Patient’s Login
NewJFrame8		:	Patient’s Sign-Up
NewJFrame9		:	Previous Record Of Patient
 
Steps Of Executing: you can go to dist > JavaApplication1>Enter
You need Java to be installed on your PC
The Server Host(172.26.59.26) must be started or you can also replace the IP with localhost to work on your local system.

Future Expectations :
A live chatbot to give advices to patient’s online
Connect To E-mitra , so people not having access to smartphones can access it
Connect to Bhamashah ,so the details are automatically fetched
The reports , tests , prescriptions will be also saved.


*Note :- The server is build with the ip connection through ethernet but now it is being plugged off so the server's local ip has been changed. We can configure for any ip within minutes. Just replace old ip with new ip source code or contact lokesh.
